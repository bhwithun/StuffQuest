"Region" differs only from "subregion" in that it has the ability to direct the player
to the world map. Both a region and a subregion are map areas, and both permit the
characters to travel to other maps. If a region is a distinct class from subregion,
then both classes must be able to point at each other (you can travel from the subregion
of Nashel Mines Floor 1 to the region of Nashkel Mines' Surface, and vice versa). They
would contain much the same code and functionality, the only difference being that a
region may grant the player access to the world map somehow. Rather than duplicate this
code, have Region be a subclass of SubRegion. This way, using the ability of one
SubRegion to point to another, a Subregion and a Region may still point at one another,
But the extended Region will have the additional functionality of accessing the World
Map, while a SubRegion does not. In this sense, you can travel amongst SubRegions freely,
and if the SubRegion you are in happens to be a Region, you may access the World Map in
addition to accessing other SubRegions.

Two things to note about this:
1. Will party members be able to be in different SubRegions from one another? "You Must
   Gather Your Party Before Venturing Forth" versus entering/exiting the Nashkel Store.
   Consider whether you can have different SubRegions loaded at the same time. Ideas:
   a. you may have any SubRegions which are connected to each other loaded in parallel.
      This would permit one character to be in Gullykin and one to be at the Firewine
      Bridge, however. The only case of "You Must Gather Your Party....." would be in
      the case of attempting to access the World Map, which would require all characters
      to be near one another in the same loaded SubRegion.
   b. you may designate certain map relationships to necessitate the party to be
      together before loading the next map. This would allow you to arbitrarily decide
      which SubRegions the characters may or may not be in at the same time. For
      instance, one character may be in Gullykin while another is in the crypt below,
      but the second could not travel from the Crypt to the Firewine Bridge until the
      first has caught up.
2. Time manipulation (such as from travelling from Friendly Arm to Nashkel) should be a
   function of the World Map rather than a Region or SubRegion.
